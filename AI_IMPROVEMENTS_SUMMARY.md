## New Features Added 🎉

### 1. **Enhanced Textarea Styling**

**Before:**
- Basic textarea with default styling
- No scroll limits
- Default scrollbar

**After:**
```css
#ai-input {
    min-height: 40px;      /* Minimum comfortable size */
    max-height: 150px;     /* Prevents excessive growth */
    overflow-y: auto;      /* Scrolls when content exceeds max */
    line-height: 1.5;      /* Better readability */
}

/* Custom scrollbar with purple theme */
#ai-input::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 6px;
}
#ai-input::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background: rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.5);  /* Purple! */
    border-radius: 3px;
}
```

**Impact:** More professional appearance, better UX for long questions

### 2. **Quick Action Buttons** 🔥

**NEW Feature - Major UX Improvement!**

Added 4 one-click buttons above the AI input:

| Button | Icon | Action | Use Case |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| **Hint** | 💡 | "Give me a hint for this lesson" | Student is stuck, needs nudge |
| **Explain** | 📚 | "Explain the concept in this lesson" | Student doesn't understand concept |
| **Debug** | 🐛 | "Help me debug my code" | Code has errors |
| **Best Practices** | ✨ | "Show me best practices for this" | Student wants to learn pro patterns |

**Implementation:**
```javascript
askQuickQuestion(question) {
    this.elements.aiInput.value = question;
    this.elements.aiInput.style.height = 'auto';
    this.elements.aiInput.style.height = (this.elements.aiInput.scrollHeight) + 'px';
    this.handleAIChat();
}
```

**Styling:**
```css
.quick-action-btn {
    background: rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.5);
    border: 1px solid rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.3);
    color: #c4b5fd;
    padding: 0.35rem 0.75rem;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    font-size: 0.75rem;
    /* ... hover effects ... */
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Makes AI more accessible to beginners
