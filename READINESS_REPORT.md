## Questions to Consider

Before starting JavaScript/TypeScript:

1. **Do you want to maintain the same 700-lesson structure?**
   - Recommendation: Yes, it's working well

2. **Which JavaScript framework to prioritize?**
   - React (most popular)
   - Vue (growing)
   - Angular (enterprise)
   - Recommendation: React + Node.js

3. **Should you add TypeScript from the start or later?**
   - Recommendation: Introduce TypeScript at Intermediate level
   - Teach vanilla JS first, then show TypeScript benefits

4. **Mobile development?**
   - React Native (extends React knowledge)
   - Could be a separate track later
