## Success Metrics

After adding these 50 lessons, students will be able to:
- ✅ **Pass system design interviews** at FAANG companies
- ✅ **Solve LeetCode Medium/Hard** problems efficiently
- ✅ **Secure production systems** against common vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Communicate effectively** with teams and stakeholders
- ✅ **Get promoted faster** with professional soft skills

---

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize by urgency:**
   - If targeting interviews: Do Algorithm Patterns first (616-630)
   - If building production systems: Do Security first (631-640)
   - If aiming for senior roles: Do System Design first (601-615)

2. **Use AI assistance:**
   - Generate lesson templates with Claude/GPT
   - Adapt existing LeetCode solutions
   - Research real system design case studies

3. **Get feedback:**
   - Test lessons with real students
   - Iterate based on completion rates
   - Add more examples where students struggle
