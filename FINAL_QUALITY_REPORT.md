## ⚠️ Issues Found (12 lessons)

### Critical - Fixed ✓

**Lesson 734: Final Capstone (Unicode Error)**
- **Issue**: Windows console couldn't display ✓/○ symbols
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to [X]/[ ] ASCII symbols
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Medium Priority - Need Review

**Lesson 450: Custom Logging Formatter (Timestamp)**
- **Issue**: Expected hardcoded timestamp, gets current time
- **Severity**: Very Low
- **Recommendation**: This is expected behavior. Update test to accept dynamic timestamps or use regex matching.

**Lesson 680: Code Review Best Practices**
- **Issue**: Review comments differ from expected (Python vs Java advice)
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Update expected output to match Python-specific review points.

**Lesson 452: Writing CSV with csv.DictWriter**
- **Issue**: Output formatting mismatch
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Verify trailing newline handling.

**Lessons 463, 467, 504: Pattern Implementations**
- **Issue**: Output mismatches
- **Severity**: Low
- **Recommendation**: Verify expected vs actual outputs.

### Low Priority - Acceptable Limitations

**Lesson 334: shared_memory ShareableList**
- **Issue**: Windows platform limitation (FileNotFoundError)
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: Works on Linux/Mac, Windows limitation is documented
- **Recommendation**: Add platform check or mark as Unix-only

**Lesson 421: Validate Input Range**
- **Issue**: Intentionally raises ValueError (by design)
- **Severity**: None
- **Status**: Working as intended for teaching exception handling

**Lessons 640, 641, 643: System Design**
- **Issue**: Text-based design outputs may vary
- **Severity**: Very Low
