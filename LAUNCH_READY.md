Title: I built a free programming platform with 611 lessons (beginner to FAANG)

Body:
After 6 months of work, I'm launching devbootLLM - a completely free
programming learning platform with 611 lessons each for Java and Python.

What makes it different:
- System Design lessons (URL Shortener, Twitter Feed, Rate Limiters)
- LeetCode-style algorithms with explanations

Just launched devbootLLM üöÄ

611 programming lessons (Java + Python)
From beginner to FAANG engineer
100% free

Thread on what makes it different üëá

Tweet 2:
Most platforms teach EITHER algorithms OR web dev

devbootLLM teaches BOTH + System Design + Security + Soft Skills

It's the complete path from zero to $200K+ job

Tweet 3:

- No cloud dependencies
- Integrates with Ollama for AI help
- Fully isolated execution

Perfect for learners who want privacy + control

Tweet 5:
611 lessons = 12+ months of study

Structured curriculum:
1-100: Fundamentals
101-200: Intermediate
201-300: Advanced
301-500: Senior
501-600: Enterprise
601-611: FAANG Prep

Clear progression from day 1 to job offer

Tweet 6:
Why I built this:

Bootcamps cost $15K+
LeetCode is $35/month
Codecademy doesn't teach System Design
Universities don't prepare you for interviews

I wanted a free, comprehensive alternative

So I built it üõ†Ô∏è
